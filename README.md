Relevant code and files for my analysis of the Rent the Runway (RTR) clothing dataset, published by UCSD’s McAuley Group.

This project explores how customers’ body types, ratings, and textual reviews relate to clothing fit outcomes. The dataset contains over 190,000 reviews, with profile features such as body type, height, weight, and fit feedback.

I am applying clustering techniques, principal component analysis, and text analysis techniques to identify patterns between customer body characteristics, review sentiment, and clothing fit outcomes. 

All coding and testing are conducted using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Dask, and Matplotlib. The analysis and experiments are run on Google Colab with storage and processing supported by Google Drive.
